## DESCRIPTION
You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although this topic lists all parameters for the cmdlet, you may not have access to some parameters if they're not included in the permissions assigned to you. To find the permissions required to run any cmdlet or parameter in your organization, see [Find the permissions required to run any Exchange cmdlet](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/find-exchange-cmdlet-permissions).

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1
```powershell
Set-TeamsProtectionPolicyRule -Identity "Teams Protection Policy Rule"-ExceptIfRecipientDomainIs research.contoso.com
```

This example modifies the existing Teams protection policy rule by excluding recipients in the domain research.contoso.com from Teams protection.

## PARAMETERS

### -Identity
The Identity parameter specifies the Teams protection policy rule that you want to modify. There's only one Teams protection policy rule in an organization named Teams Protection Policy Rule.

```yaml
Type: RuleIdParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Online

Required: True
Position: 1
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByPropertyName, ByValue)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Comments
The Comments parameter specifies informative comments for the rule, such as what the rule is used for or how it has changed over time. The length of the comment can't exceed 1024 characters.

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Online

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Confirm
The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

- Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: `-Confirm:$false`.
- Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: cf
Applicable: Exchange Online

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -ExceptIfRecipientDomainIs
The ExceptIfRecipientDomainIs parameter specifies an exception to Teams protection that looks for recipients of Teams messages with email addresses in the specified domains. You can specify multiple domains separated by commas.

```yaml
Type: Word[]
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Online

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -ExceptIfSentTo
The ExceptIfSentTo parameter specifies an exception to Teams protection that looks for recipients of Teams messages. You can use any value that uniquely identifies the recipient. For example:

- Name
- Alias
- Distinguished name (DN)
- Canonical DN
- Email address
- GUID

You can enter multiple values separated by commas. If the values contain spaces or otherwise require quotation marks, use the following syntax: `"Value1","Value2",..."ValueN"`.

```yaml
Type: RecipientIdParameter[]
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Online

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -ExceptIfSentToMemberOf
The ExceptIfSentToMemberOf parameter specifies an exception to Teams protection that looks for Teams messages sent to members of distribution groups or mail-enabled security groups. You can use any value that uniquely identifies the group. For example:

- Name
- Alias
- Distinguished name (DN)
- Canonical DN
- Email address
- GUID

You can enter multiple values separated by commas. If the values contain spaces or otherwise require quotation marks, use the following syntax: `"Value1","Value2",..."ValueN"`.

If you remove the group after you create the rule, no exception is made for Teams messages that are sent to members of the group.

```yaml
Type: RecipientIdParameter[]
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Online

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -WhatIf
The WhatIf switch simulates the actions of the command. You can use this switch to view the changes that would occur without actually applying those changes. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: wi
Applicable: Exchange Online

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```
